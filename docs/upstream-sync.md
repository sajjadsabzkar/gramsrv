## Sync History

| Date | Source commit | Target commit | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-06-09 | `488e409a1898e9c739cc0bd24cb9791636dfd6b3` | `23a2b2a` | synced | Restored sticker path placeholders, media in dialogs/history, media forwarding to channels, and channel history pagination fixes. Source README changes were already covered by the public repo's gramsrv README wording, so no README file changed in the target cherry-pick. |

## Next Sync

Start the next batch from source commits after `77b033c8bf8c0a76ff0d7065e2192cbe55d3a3b6`.
At the time this log was created, newer `telesrv` commits existed after that point and were
intentionally left out because the latest batch was scoped to the next two commits after
`c0a0e5b52240ed415d3b43ba77659821887bf50b`.
